Setting up a Yocto Autobuilder Build Cluster
============================================

Most autobuilder setups are individual to the circumstances of the
user. This document outlines some of the configuration options/files,
autobuilder setup gotchas and general autobuilder best practices.

Setup
=====

1. Setting the Yocto autobuilder up to run headless sanity tests

    If you plan on using the yocto autobuilder to run sanity testing,
    you will need to:

    1. Install tight-vnc client and server.

    2. Set up tap devs by running poky/scripts/runqemu-setup-tapdev

    3. Add "xterm*vt100*geometry: 80x50+10+10" to .Xdefaults

    4. Setup and start vnc session as the autobuilder user.

    5. You MUST manually connect to the vnc session at least once prior to
       running a qemu sanity test (Something is getting set during the initial
       connection that I haven't figured out yet. Manually connecting seems to
       set up the session correctly.)

2. Adding additional build workers

    The production yocto autobuilder uses a cluster of build workers, all
    sharing the same SSTATE_DIR and DL_DIR via an NFS4 mounted NAS. The main
    nightly trigger prepopulates the DL_DIR, allowing the workers to not have
    to deal with a lot of downloading. In theory you could also run your build
    workers with NO_NETWORK to enforce a single point of populating DL_DIR.

    Running multiple build workers is fairly simple, but does require some setup:

    a. Ensure the settings in autobuilder.conf are valid for each buildworker,
       As certain variables are set within this file that are work with the
       local configuruation on each builder.

    b. Within yocto-controller/controller.cfg add your worker to the
       c['workers'] list inside of the BUILDWORKERS section

    c. For each build worker change the WORKER SETTINGS section of
       yocto-worker/buildbot.tac to match the settings in controller.cfg.

3. Setting up build history.

    Build History is used to track changes to packages and images. By default
    the autobuilder does not collect build history. The production autobuilder
    does have this functionality enabled.

    Setting up build history requires the following steps:

    1. Create an empty git repo. Make a single commit to it and the create and
       push branches for each of the nightly core architectures (ie. mips, ppc,
       x86...)

    2. Find a central location to create a clone for this. This works best if
       you have a set up similar to the production autobuilder (NAS with many
       builders)

    3. Run the following:

        # This is an example of how to set up a local build history checkout. Paths
        # obviously are situation dependant.
        mkdir /nas/buildhistory
        cd /nas/buildhistory
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory nightly-arm
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory nightly-x86
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory nightly-x86-64
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory nightly-ppc
        git clone ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory nightly-mips
        for x in `ls|grep nightly` do cd $x; git checkout $x; cd /nas/buildhistory; done

    4. Within the autobuilder.conf of EACH slave change the following:

        BUILD_HISTORY_COLLECT = True
        BUILD_HISTORY_DIR = "/nas/buildhistory"
        BUILD_HISTORY_REPO = "ssh://git@git.myproject.org/buildhistory"

Files used for Yocto-Autobuilder Configuration
==============================================

Name: conf/autobuilder.conf
Purpose:
This file is used to set autobuilder wide parameters, like where various build
artifacts are published to, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR or if build artifacts should be
published (needed for production autobuilders, not needed for desktop builders)

Name: conf/yoctoAB.conf
Purpose:
This is the main yocto autobuilder config. Documentation for this and associated
format is in README_CONFIG
